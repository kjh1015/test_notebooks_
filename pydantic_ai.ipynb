      "Albert Einstein was a theoretical physicist widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential scientists of all time. Born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, in the Kingdom of Württemberg in the German Empire, he developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (the other being quantum mechanics). His mass-energy equivalence formula \\(E=mc^2\\) is among the most famous equations in physics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Einstein's work had a significant impact on the development of atomic energy and quantum theory. He received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his explanation of the photoelectric effect, which was pivotal in establishing the quantum theory. Beyond his contributions to physics, Einstein was known for his philosophical insights on science, his advocacy for civil rights, his pacifism (though he later urged the Allies to develop the atomic bomb during World War II), and his humanitarian efforts.\n",
      "\n",
      "He spent the last two decades of his life in the United States, working at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. Albert Einstein died on April 18, 1955, in Princeton.\n",
      "Albert Einstein's most famous equation is \\(E=mc^2\\), which expresses the equivalence of energy (\\(E\\)) and mass (\\(m\\)), with \\(c\\) being the speed of light in a vacuum (\\(c \\approx 299,792,458 \\text{ meters per second}\\)). This equation is derived from his theory of relativity and demonstrates that mass and energy are interchangeable; they can be converted into each other. The implication of this equation is profound, as it signifies that a small amount of mass can be converted into a large amount of energy, which is the principle behind nuclear reactions in stars and nuclear power.\n"

    "4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n",
    "5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n",
    "6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n",
    "7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs might derail you from the true variables.\n",
